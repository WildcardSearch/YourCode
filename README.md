## YourCode 1.1.1

*Forget MyCode. Take control of YourCode-- a much better way of handling BB Code for MyBB forums*

YourCode completely takes over MyCode-- even the menu item and link are replaced. At install all of the existing, internally cached MyCodes are converted to the more versatile YourCode version as well as all the existing Custom MyCodes you have created.

These internal MyCodes are safely contained within the parser class so you may freely edit, control activation, apply new options to them-- even delete  them-- all with the knowledge that you are a click away from restoring them.

At uninstall everything goes back to normal. No trash left behind and no effects.

## Features

* YourCode is nestable.
* YourCode can use a wider range of regex options including case sensitivity, single line, multi-line and eval() modes.
* YourCode can Import/Export to XML files to share, backup or restore your work-- one at a time or en mass.
* YourCode uses MyBB's internal parser to handle the actual regex replacements so its footprint is minimal.
* YourCode can have individual group permission for use and viewing separately.
* YourCode has alternate replacements for those who do not have permission to view them.
* YourCode has tools to backup and restore your entire YourCode collection at once and you can restore the default MyCodes with a click.
